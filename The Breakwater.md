Waves leap upon the shore. The moon is reclining behind covers. Two men are on the rocks, silhouetted to the horizon. They both take after the waters, but one has took hold of the raging sea and the other a still stream.

Bill tips closely to one side.

The rocks jutted out every which way. Not much for walking, really. None are flat and even, or leveled. Some pointed straight up, like pre-historic stone daggers. Some slanted into the water, covered, wet. It is good that both had proper shoes.

"Why are we out here?" He points around, pointing to the impossible plight of hopping around the large, sharp rocks in the dark.

"We have to reach the green light, Bill."

The ponderous man scrambles another step. And another. To the next big rock. The little ones tend to wobble.

"I know I am being silly. Dragging you out here. I am sorry. I really want to get to that green light. "

"Besides, " he adds, "it would be a good place to smoke up."

They walk for another fifteen minutes in silence. More intent on the way then the journey. Against the night, the far-off beacon is the only light in the world.

They skip. They hop. They lever their bodies off sharp ridges. It is more of a climb than a walk. All the things that might bring them relief, the moon, the star, the warm breeze. All these things seem to have hidden from them. Yet, they move on.

When they got there, they find not a single rung on the smooth metalic sides of the beacon-tower.

"We can't get on top of it." He digs his palms and fingers to the steel sides and leaves not a mark.

"So, that's it then," Bill says.

The long climb, and now --- Nothing. He thrusts his arm. A knuckle clashes against the white metal. His small fist imitates the surrounding waves.

Eyeing the shore, the ponderous man, Bill, heaves himself onto a distant rock. His friend follows. He stretches his red knuckles and lunges over every craggy surface. Rapaciously. Dips, but never floundering. Slips, but never falling.
